    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Tom's Fly Shop</h2>
    <p>
      My project proposal is a website that sells fishing lures called "flies"
      which are hand crafted by me. The objective of the website will be to sell
      my flies, teach and encourage people to get into fly fishing, and educate
      people on fish species that are in need of conservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My target audience will be mainly fisherman. Fisherman of all skill levels
      who are looking for quality flies at a reasonable price, or, want to learn
      more about fly fishing. The Website will include a 'products' page, an
      'about' page, an intro to fly fishing/fly tying page, and a page dedicated
      to native fish conservation which provides links to ways to get involved
      in the cause. All in addition to homapge, sitemap, and contact pages.
