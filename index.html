        My name is Thomas Stasko. I am 21 years old from Fairfield Connecticut
        and my favorite type of cuisine is Italian. I have a younger brother
        named Luke. My hobbies include, fishing, skiing, cooking, golf, and
        baseball. I also am very knowlegable of diesel engines. A fun fact about
        me is that I am a citizen of France as well as the United States!

      I came to
      <a href="https://www.babson.edu/"
        >Babson College</a
      >
      because of its reputation as a strong business school and diverse student
      body. Babson also provided me the opportunity to continue my atheltic
      career, although I no longer play on a varsity team. After graduation I
      plan to work for an outdoors company and put my marketing skills to work,
      while continuing to fish as much as possible. I hope to own my own boat
      one day and start a charter/commercial fishing business.

        My first hobby is fishing. I taught myself how to fish when I was 13
        years old. Growing up in a coastal town in the northeast, my favorite
        fish to catch was striped bass because of their beauty and their ability
        to adapt to many different marine environments. I make my own flies and
        wooden lures to catch them. I also love to target
        <a

          >bluefin</a
        >
        and yellowfin tuna. The largest tuna I have ever caught was over 100
        inches long and weighed over 300 pounds. Although I still fish in the
        winter, I spend more time skiing than fishing during this time. I have
        been skiing for 15 years. I would like to one day ski somehere other
        than the east coast of the US.
